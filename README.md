# Quiz Application

This project is a **React-based quiz application** inspired by the popular TV game show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?". Users can participate in a general knowledge quiz, progressing through increasingly valuable prize levels for every correct answer. The application features dynamic state management for game logic and scoring, and incorporates interactive sound effects for an immersive gameplay experience.

## Features

- **Scoring**: For every correct answer, the prize value increases, giving users a sense of progression.
- **Sound Effects**: Interactive sound effects are included to enhance user engagement and immerse them in the quiz experience. 
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, providing a great experience across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **State Management**: React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) and custom state logic to handle the quiz flow and game data.
